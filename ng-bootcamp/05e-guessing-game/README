Guessing game:

The user can input a number and submit it. The number will be compared to a property on the controller. If the user guesses correctly it will display the message and hide the input/button. If the user guesses incorrectly, a message is displayed indicating a high or low guess. With every guess, any previous messages should be removed. The number of guesses will also be tracked and displayed.
